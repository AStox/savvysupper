Fettucini Alfredo with mushroom and butternut squash
Serves 3 or more
Cook time: 20 min
3 tablespoons unsalted butter
2 cups chopped cremini mushrooms, in pieces roughly the size of beans
1 large yellow onion, finely diced (about 2 cups)
2 teaspoons (heaping) kosher salt, plus 1 large pinch
1/2 teaspoon freshly cracked black or white pepper
1 1/2 pound chopped butternut squash, seeds and skin removed, in roughly 3/4-inch cubes
1 cup white wine
3/4 cups heavy cream
1 pinch ground nutmeg
1/2 pound (dried) fettuccine noodles
1/4 cup water, room temperature
1 cup grated Parmesan (tightly packed, about 2.5 ounces), plus more for serving
Instructions
Turn your multi-cooker on to its sauté setting. Add the butter, let it melt, and then add the mushrooms. Sauté until they’re browned all over, about 5 minutes. Remove them from the pot with a slotted spoon and set aside. Add the onions, squash, 2 heaping teaspoons salt, and pepper. Sauté a few more minutes, mixing every so often, until the onions are beginning to turn translucent.
Add the wine. Pause for a few moments to let the wine come to a simmer, as you scrape up the browned bits on the bottom of the pan. Add the cream and nutmeg, stir, and let the mixture come back to a simmer. Take the uncooked noodles in a bundle and use your hands to break them in half, so you have noodles that are 1/2 the length of normal fettuccine. Add them to the pot of vegetables and liquid, along with 1/4 cup water, and stir to submerge the noodles as much as you can (it’s okay if they’re sticking out a tiny bit at the top—they'll slump into the liquid as they cook). Put the lid on the cooker and turn to pressure cook mode on high for 5 minutes (or for 6 minutes if you like your noodles more well-done, less al dente).
Once the pressure cooking has finished, let the pressure release naturally for a few minutes before turning your steam valve to allow a quick release. Add the grated Parmesan, the reserved browned mushrooms, and the additional pinch of salt. Toss with the pasta and sauce until the cheese has melted and the sauce becomes a creamy, glossy coating to the noodles. (The fettuccine will cook a little more as you toss.) Let any softened chunks of squash that want to break up as you stir do so. Top individual bowls with more grated Parmesan.

Add garlic and onion to pan, reduce heat to medium low. Season with remaining 1-teaspoon salt, sauté 3 minutes while scraping up any browned bits that may have stuck to the pan. Stir in cumin, ginger, cinnamon, turmeric, allspice and clove; sauté 1 more minute.
Return beef to pan, stir in beef broth, turn heat to medium high and bring to simmer. Reduce to medium low, affix lid and simmer 10 minutes.
Spread cauliflower atop stew, replace lid, simmer 5 minutes. Finally, add squash, garbanzo beans and kale; return lid and simmer an additional 5 minutes.
Remove lid and, with a large spoon, stir all ingredients together to coat all vegetables with broth.

Asian Dry Baby Back Pork Ribs
Serves 2 to 4
For the baby back rack of pork ribs:
1 large rack of baby back pork ribs, cut into segments
1 pinch Sea salt
1 pinch Black pepper
1 tablespoon vegetable oil
For the dry rub spice mix:
1 tablespoon ground ginger
2 teaspoons turmeric
1 1/2 teaspoon garlic powder
2 teaspoons cardamom
1 pinch cayenne pepper to taste
Cut the ribs into individual ribs and place them on a flat work surface covered with wax paper. Coat with a bit of olive oil (about 1 tablespoon) and season both sides with sea salt and pepper to taste. Mix all of the remaining spices together in a small bowl and rub the spice blend on all sides of the ribs until evenly covered. Place the ribs in a well-sealed plastic bag and refrigerate for at least 2 to 3 hours (overnight is best).
Remove the ribs from the fridge about 15 to 20 minutes before you want to roast them, and bring to room temperature. Line a metal baking sheet with aluminum foil and place the ribs on the foil.
Set oven to anywhere between 400 to 425° F and roast the ribs until golden brown and cooked through (the time will vary depending on the heat of your oven and the thickness of the ribs, but start checking around 40 minutes). For crispier ribs, place them under the broiler a minute or two before they're finished. Remove from oven to cool and serve.

Chicken & Tofu Laksa
Serves 5
2 cups firm tofu, cut into bite-sized pieces
2 tablespoons coriander seeds
1 tablespoon black peppercorns
1 tablespoon cumin seeds
1 tablespoon fennel seeds
4 cloves
1/4 teaspoon ground turmeric
8 chiles de árbol, stemmed
4 tablespoons canola or vegetable oil, divided
3 shallots, sliced
1 pound boneless, skinless chicken thighs or breasts, cut into 1-inch pieces
1 teaspoon shrimp paste (available in the Asian aisle of supermarkets or at Asian markets); omit if you're adding shrimp or prawns
1 (13 1/2–ounce) can unsweetened coconut milk
2 teaspoons sugar
1/2 teaspoon salt, plus more to taste
1 cinnamon stick
2 lemon grass stalks, bottom three inches, tough outer skin removed, lightly crushed (just to start the juices releasing)
1 quart low-sodium chicken broth
1 pound rice noodles, cooked to package directions (I use wide ones, but this is a personal preference)
1/2 cup mung beans (canned is fine if you can't find them fresh, but make sure to rinse and drain them)
1/3 cup mint leaves, roughly chopped (optional, for garnish)
1/3 cup cilantro, chopped (for garnish)
2 limes, cut into wedges (for garnish)
Bring well salted water to a boil. Put the tofu in a bowl and pour the salted water over the tofu. Let sit for 15 minutes.
Grind coriander, peppercorns, cumin, fennel, cloves, turmeric, and chiles. Set aside.
Remove tofu from water and place in a single layer on a clean dishcloth to dry. Cover with another towel and pat dry.
Heat 1 tablespoon of the oil in a non-stick skillet or a wok over high heat. Add the tofu in batches and fry until golden brown. Don't overcrowd the pan. Set the tofu aside to cool.
Heat the rest of the oil in a large pot over medium heat. When the oil glistens, add the shallots and ground spices. Cook, stirring often, just until the shallots start to become translucent, about 1 minute.
Add the chicken and shrimp paste, and continue to cook, 1 to 2 minutes more. Turn down the heat if the spices or shallots look like they're going to burn.
Add the coconut milk, sugar, salt, cinnamon stick, tofu, lemon grass, and chicken broth.
Return the temperature to a boil, then reduce to a simmer. Cover and cook for twenty minutes or so, until the chicken is cooked through.
Cook the noodles according to the package instructions.
Divide the noodles among the serving bowls. Spoon the broth over the noodles. Top with mung beans, then garnish with the mint and cilantro. Add a lime wedge to each bowl and serve immediately.

Coconut-Braised Chicken With Potatoes
Yield:4 servings
1(13-ounce) can unsweetened full-fat coconut milk
4 teaspoons minced or grated fresh ginger (from a 1½-inch piece)
2 limes, 1 zested and juiced (about ½ teaspoon and 1 tablespoon) and 1 halved
1 tablespoon ground turmeric
1 tablespoon ground cumin
½teaspoon red-pepper flakes
½teaspoon whole black peppercorns
Kosher salt
1½pounds small (about ¾-inch) yellow baby potatoes (larger ones halved)
2½pounds bone-in, skin-on chicken parts, thighs or drumsticks, excess fat and skin trimmed
¼cup fresh cilantro leaves, roughly chopped or torn
2scallions, thinly sliced
White rice or bread (such as naan or pita), for serving
Instructions
Heat the oven to 350 degrees.
In a large Dutch oven or lidded oven-proof pot, add the coconut milk, ginger, lime zest and juice, turmeric, cumin, red-pepper flakes, peppercorns and 2 teaspoons salt; stir using a fork to dissolve any coconut clumps. Mix in the potatoes. Add the chicken, turn the pieces to coat in the liquid, then set them skin-side down, making sure they are halfway submerged. (It’s OK if everything is snug and potatoes are on top of the chicken.) Cover and cook for 1 hour in the center of the oven.
Remove the lid, then use tongs to turn the chicken pieces over so they are skin-side up. Cook, uncovered, until the chicken is tender, falling off the bone and the potatoes are easily pierced with a fork, about 30 minutes more. Season to taste with salt.
Squeeze ½ lime over the dish and cut the remaining lime into 4 wedges to serve at the table. Top the braised chicken with the cilantro and scallions, and serve with rice or bread.

Pernil Style Roasted Chicken thighs
Yield:4 servings
¼cup neutral oil (such as safflower or canola)
2 tablespoons freshly squeezed orange juice
1 tablespoon fresh lime juice, plus wedges for serving
5 garlic cloves, minced
2 tablespoons chopped fresh oregano leaves
½teaspoon granulated onion or onion powder
Salt and pepper
8bone-in, skin-on chicken thighs (about 3 pounds)
1 medium yellow onion, chopped into 1-inch pieces
2 tablespoons chopped cilantro leaves, plus more for garnish
Cooked rice or corn tortillas and hot sauce (optional), for serving
Instructions
Heat oven to 425 degrees. In a small bowl, combine oil, orange juice, lime juice, garlic, oregano and granulated onion. Season with salt and pepper; mix well.
On a large rimmed baking sheet, combine chicken and chopped onion and season generously with salt and pepper. Add the citrus-herb oil and toss to evenly coat, massaging the oil into the flesh side of the chicken. Arrange onions and chicken, skin side up, in a single layer and roast until golden and crispy, about 40 minutes.
Transfer chicken and onions to a cutting board and let rest until cool enough to handle, 5 to 10 minutes. Pour off pan juices from baking sheet, scraping off any caramelized browned bits into a small bowl, and degrease, spooning off any excess oil from the top.
Discard bones and coarsely chop chicken. Divide chicken and onions among 4 plates and spoon reserved pan sauce on top. Garnish with cilantro and serve with rice or tortillas, if desired, plus lime wedges and hot sauce, if using.

Skillet Chicken with Turmeric and Orange
Yield:4 servings
½medium onion, diced into ¼-inch pieces
5 tablespoons olive oil
1 tablespoon honey
2 teaspoons dried mint
3 garlic cloves, crushed or finely chopped
1 tablespoon grated orange zest (from about 2 large oranges), plus ¼ cup orange juice
1 teaspoon ground turmeric
¾ teaspoon fine sea salt
¼ teaspoon black pepper
1 pound boneless, skinless chicken thighs or breasts
Marinate the chicken: Place the onion, 2 tablespoons olive oil, honey, dried mint, garlic, orange zest, orange juice, turmeric, salt and black pepper in a large bowl and stir to combine. Add the chicken and turn to coat with the marinade. Cover and leave in the fridge until ready to cook or for up to 12 hours.
When ready to cook, heat the remaining 3 tablespoons olive oil in a large (12-inch) skillet or frying pan over medium-high and wait for the pan to become very hot. (This ensures a nice sear.)
Add the chicken and the marinade to the pan, and cook until chicken is browned underneath and easily releases from the pan, 5 to 8 minutes. Stir the onions every now and then so that they cook evenly. If the pan looks dry, add a couple of tablespoons of water to the pan to prevent the juices from drying out. Flip the chicken and cook on the other side until the chicken is cooked through, another 5 to 8 minutes. S

Pork Gyros
Yield:6 servings
2½ pounds pork shoulder
Juice of 2 lemons
¼ cup plus 1 tablespoon extra-virgin olive oil
8 cloves garlic, peeled and minced
1 medium-size tomato
2 medium-size yellow onions, peeled
1 tablespoon plus 1 teaspoon smoked or sweet paprika
1 tablespoon kosher salt
2teaspoons freshly ground black pepper
1½tablespoons fresh oregano leaves, approximately 5 sprigs
Instructions
Put pork shoulder on a plate, and place in the freezer for approximately 1 hour, or until it is firm to the touch. Put meat on a cutting board, and using a sharp knife, remove and discard any skin, then slice the meat thinly against the grain, into ½-inch slices.
Make the marinade. In a large bowl, whisk together the lemon juice, ¼ cup olive oil and garlic. Using a box grater, grate the tomato and one of the onions into the marinade, then add 1 tablespoon of the paprika, along with the salt, pepper and oregano leaves. Whisk again, then place the sliced pork into the marinade, toss to combine and cover and refrigerate the meat for at least one hour and up to overnight.
When ready to cook, heat oven to 450. Use the remaining tablespoon of olive oil to grease a rimmed sheet pan. Quarter the remaining onion, add it to the pork and marinade and toss once to combine. Remove the pork and onion from the marinade, and place on the pan, spreading everything evenly across it.
Put the pork in the oven, and roast until it is browned, crisp at the edges and cooked through, about 30-40 minutes. Check the meat at around 20 minutes to see how much liquid is in the pan. If there is a lot, remove the pan, and pour off all but a few tablespoons. Remove the finished pork from the oven, allow to rest for a minute or two, then chop into bits. (To make the pork even crisper, set a large pan over high heat, add a tablespoon of olive oil to the pan, then the sliced pork, and sauté until everything curls tight in the heat.) Scatter the remaining paprika over the top of the meat, and serve with warm pita, sliced cucumbers and onions, tomato, tzatziki sauce, hot sauce, French fries, scattered mint leaves, ketchup, really whatever you like.

Pork tenderloin with mushrooms
Ingredients
2 rosemary sprigs
4 garlic cloves, smashed and peeled
½teaspoon fennel seeds (optional)
Salt and pepper
1 pork tenderloin (1 to 1¼ pounds), silver skin removed (see Tip), meat halved crosswise and patted dry
3 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil
8 ounces mixed mushrooms, torn into 1-inch pieces
2 tablespoons unsalted butter, sliced
2 teaspoons red or white wine vinegar
Instructions
Heat the oven to 425 degrees. Pluck 1 tablespoon leaves from the rosemary sprigs (reserve the rest). Using a mortar and pestle or knife and cutting board, combine the rosemary leaves, 3 garlic cloves, the fennel seeds (if using) and a pinch of salt and pepper. Pound or chop until a coarse paste forms. Season the pork with salt, then coat with the garlic-rosemary mixture. (You can season and refrigerate the pork up to 8 hours ahead.)
Heat the oil in a large, oven-proof skillet over medium-high. Add the pork and scatter the mushrooms around (skillet might be snug). Sear until browned underneath, 4 to 5 minutes. Season the mushrooms with salt and pepper and add the butter, remaining garlic clove and the reserved rosemary sprigs. Flip the pork, stir the mushrooms and spread them to fill the skillet. Roast, stirring the mushrooms halfway through, until a thermometer inserted into the thickest part of the pork registers between 140 and 145 degrees, 10 to 12 minutes.
Transfer the pork to a cutting board to rest at least 5 minutes. Stir the vinegar into the mushrooms and scrape up any browned bits stuck to the bottom of the skillet. Thinly slice the pork and serve with the mushrooms, spooning the pan drippings over top.

Harrissa Honey Pork Tenderloin
Ingredients
2 to 3 servings
¼cup harissa paste or 1 teaspoon harissa spice powder
2tablespoons honey
1pork tenderloin (1 to 1¼ pounds), silver skin removed, meat halved crosswise and patted dry
Salt and pepper
2teaspoons neutral oil, such as grapeseed or canola
Instructions
Heat the oven to 375 degrees. In a small bowl, stir together the harissa and honey. On a plate, season the pork all over with salt and pepper (about 1 teaspoon Diamond Crystal kosher salt or ½ teaspoon fine sea salt). Rub a thin layer of the harissa-honey mixture all over the pork and reserve the rest.
Heat the oil in a medium ovenproof skillet over medium-high. Add the pork and cook until very browned on two sides, 2 to 4 minutes per side. Decrease the heat if the pork is burning; hold onto the plate.
Turn off the heat and return the pork to the plate. Rub the pork all over with the remaining harissa-honey mixture. Remove any burnt bits from the skillet, then return the pork to the skillet and roast until a thermometer in the thickest part registers between 140 and 145 degrees, 8 to 12 minutes. (The thinner, tapered piece of meat may be ready first, so check both pieces and remove them as they’re done.)
Transfer to a cutting board to rest at least 10 minutes (the meat’s internal temperature will continue to climb), then slice and serve with the juices poured over.

Hoisin-Glazed Pork Bowl With Vegetables
Ingredients
Yield:4 servings
½cup hoisin sauce
2 tablespoons ketchup
2 tablespoons honey
1 tablespoon grated fresh ginger
2 teaspoons Sriracha
1 large garlic clove, grated on a Microplane
1 teaspoon Chinese five-spice powder
1 pork tenderloin (about 1 to 1¼ pounds), cut crosswise into thirds
Kosher salt and freshly ground pepper
2 teaspoons vegetable oil
2 small carrots, peeled
2 large radishes (such as watermelon), or 4 small
4 scallions
1 tablespoon rice wine vinegar
4 cups cooked brown or black rice
2 ounces snow peas, trimmed
Pickled ginger (optional)
Instructions
In a medium bowl, combine hoisin, ketchup, honey, ginger, Sriracha, garlic and five-spice powder.
Season pork with ¾ teaspoon salt and ½ teaspoon pepper, then add to the marinade. Toss to evenly coat, cover, and set aside. You can let the pork marinate, covered and refrigerated for up to 24 hours, or you can cook it right away.
Heat oven to 375 degrees. Heat oil in a large (12-inch) nonstick, oven-proof skillet over medium-high. Remove pork from marinade, letting excess drip back into the bowl. (Reserve marinade.) Sear pork for 2 to 3 minutes on the first side and about 2 minutes on the other, until nicely browned and caramelized.
Remove from heat and pour remaining marinade over the pork, turning to coat evenly. Transfer pan to the oven and cook, turning in the sauce occasionally, for 10 to 20 minutes, or until an instant-read thermometer reads 145 degrees. (The smallest piece of pork, from the thin end of the tenderloin will be done first, so begin checking temperature at 10 minutes and remove pieces from the oven as they are done.)
Meanwhile, prepare the vegetables: Use a peeler to shave the carrots lengthwise into strips. Slice the radishes paper-thin using a mandoline. Thinly slice the scallions on an angle.
Transfer pork to a plate and set aside to rest. Add rice wine vinegar and 2 tablespoons of water to the skillet and cook over medium-high, stirring constantly until you have a smooth sauce, adding more water if needed. It should be the consistency of heavy cream. Transfer to a small bowl, stirring in any juices that accumulated from the plate with the pork.
Distribute rice among 4 bowls. Thinly slice the pork and divide among the bowls. Drizzle the sauce over the pork and rice and garnish each bowl with the carrots, radishes, scallions, snow peas and pickled ginger, if using. Serve immediately.
